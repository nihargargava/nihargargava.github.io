<h1 id="what-are-lattices">What are lattices?</h1>
<p>Consider <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}^d\)</span> with the standard inner product. A lattice <span class="math inline">\(\Lambda\subseteq \mathbb{R}^d\)</span> is a discrete subgroup such that the quotient space <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}^d / \Lambda\)</span> has a finite induced volume which we henceforth will call the covolume of <span class="math inline">\(\Lambda\)</span>. Throughout this article, we only mean lattices to denote these Euclidean lattices.</p>
<p>A more simple but equivalent idea of a lattice is that it is a set <span class="math display">\[\begin{equation}
  \Lambda = \mathbb{Z}v_1 + \mathbb{Z} v_2  + \dots + \mathbb{Z} v_d,
\end{equation}\]</span> for some <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> vectors <span class="math inline">\(v_1,v_2,\dots,v_d \in \mathbb{R}^d\)</span>. If we were to write instead take <span class="math inline">\(\Lambda&#39; = \mathbb{Z} w_1 + \dots + \mathbb{Z} w_d\)</span> for some other basis of vectors <span class="math inline">\(w_1, \dots, w_d \in \mathbb{R}^{d}\)</span>, we must get the relation that <span class="math inline">\(\Lambda&#39; = \Lambda\)</span> will be the same lattice if and only if <span class="math display">\[\begin{equation}
    w_i = \sum_{j=1}^{d}a_{ij} v_j, \text{ for some } a_{ij} \in \mathbb{Z}
\end{equation}\]</span> and the <span class="math inline">\(a_{ij}\)</span> form a matrix whose inverse also has integer entries. Such a matrix <span class="math inline">\([a_{ij}]\)</span> must have determinant <span class="math inline">\(\pm 1\)</span>. The covolume of the lattice <span class="math inline">\(\Lambda\)</span> in this point of view is the volume of a <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span>-dimensional parallelepiped that the vectors <span class="math inline">\(v_1,\dots,v_d\)</span> span, or in other words the absolute value of a matrix whose columns are <span class="math inline">\(v_1\dots v_d\)</span>.</p>
<p>Lattices are fascinating objects with connections to number theory, physics, Lattice arrangements connect with many areas in mathematics such as string theory, harmonic analysis, hyperbolic geometry, finite groups, error-correcting codes and some very beautiful areas of number theory like elliptic curves, modular forms, finite fields, etc <span class="citation" data-cites="CS">[<a href="#ref-CS" role="doc-biblioref">1</a>]</span>.</p>
<p><strong>SOME PICTURES OF LATTICES</strong></p>
<h1 id="post-quantum-cryptography-and-lattices">Post quantum cryptography and lattices</h1>
<p>Lattice-based cryptography is an emerging area that relies on the computational difficulty in finding short vectors in a lattice. In most lattice-based encryption protocols, if an unauthorized adversary is able to decipher the encrypted messages, they can do so only with the aid of an efficient algorithm to find short lattice vectors which whose existence is known to be near-impossible (NP-Hard).</p>
<p>However, to speed up the encryption algorithms, there is an intense emerging interest in lattices that have additional algebraic structure. Indeed, at least two of the recent finalists in NISTâ€™s Post-Quantum Cryptography Standardization are based on the ring of integers in cyclotomic number fields. These are lattices in smallest possible dimension that admit symmetries under a given cyclic group. It is still a largely</p>
<h1 id="homogeneous-spaces">Homogeneous spaces</h1>
<p><span class="math inline">\(\DeclareMathOperator{\SL}{SL}\)</span> Let <span class="math inline">\(\SL_d(\mathbb{R})\)</span> denote the group of unimodular square matrices of size <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span>. Then the equivalence of the two definitions of lattices mentioned above imply that the following is a surjective map onto unit covolume lattices in <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}^{d}\)</span>. <span class="math display">\[\begin{equation}
  g \mapsto g \mathbb{Z}^{d} , \ g \in \SL_d(\mathbb{R}).
\end{equation}\]</span> This informs us that the space of unit covolume lattices is in bijection with <span class="math inline">\(\SL_d(\mathbb{R})/\SL_d(\mathbb{Z})\)</span>. This has the structure of a smooth <span class="math inline">\((d^{2}-1)\)</span>-dimensional manifold. On this space, there is a canonical description of a measure due to the general theory of Haar measure on locally compact groups (see <span class="citation" data-cites="N1976">[<a href="#ref-N1976" role="doc-biblioref">2</a>]</span>). What this means is that there is a natural way to compute volumes of reasonably defined subsets <span class="math inline">\(A \subseteq \SL_d(\mathbb{R})/\SL_d(\mathbb{Z})\)</span>. What is remarkable about this construction is that even though it is not compact, the amount of space inside <span class="math inline">\(\SL(\mathbb{R})/\SL(\mathbb{Z})\)</span> is finite. Hence it is a probability space.</p>
<p>This space <span class="math inline">\(\SL_d(\mathbb{R})/\SL_d(\mathbb{Z})\)</span> is a standard example of what is called a homogeneous space. Loosely put, a homogeneous space is a space with a continuous group of symmetries, in this case <span class="math inline">\(\SL_d(\mathbb{R})\)</span>. Homogeneous spaces are related to lots of fascinating areas in mathematics and physics, and continue to bridge breathtaking connections in geometry, number theory and dynamics.</p>
<h1 id="division-algebras">Division algebras</h1>
<p>A seemingly unrelated rings that have all the axioms of a field except that it may not be commutative. A division alebra over a field <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> is a finite dimensional vector space over <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>.</p>
<p>William Hamilton was the first person to discover a division algebra over <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}\)</span> which is the only non-commutative one over <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}\)</span> (apart from <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{C}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}\)</span> itself, which are commutative). Over <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{Q}\)</span>, there are infinitely many non-commutative division algebras, apart from just the number fields which are commutative. All such division algebras are known to be cylic division algebras.</p>
<h1 id="random-lattices-with-arithmetic-structure">Random lattices with arithmetic structure</h1>
<p>Given a lattice <span class="math inline">\(\Lambda\)</span>, choose <span class="math inline">\(r= r_{\text{pack}}\)</span> and consider the open balls <span class="math inline">\(\{ B_{r}\left( v \right)\}_{v \in \Lambda}\)</span>, which implies that for any <span class="math inline">\(v_1, v_2 \in \Lambda\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(B_{r}(v_1) \cap B_{r}(v_2) \neq \emptyset \Rightarrow v_1 = v_2\)</span>. Here <span class="math inline">\(r_{\text{pack}}\)</span> is the packing radius of the lattice, i.e., half of the length of the shortest non-zero vector.</p>
<p>This setup of spheres is called a lattice sphere packing, or simply lattice packing inside <span class="math inline">\((\mathbb{R}^d, \langle \ , \ \rangle)\)</span>. Packing density of a lattice packing is <span class="math display">\[\begin{equation}
 \Delta(\Lambda) = \lim_{R \rightarrow \infty} \frac{\mu\left( B_{R}(0) \cap \left(  \bigsqcup_{v \in \Lambda} B_{r}(v) \right) \right)}{\mu\left( B_{R}(0) \right)} = \frac{\mu( B_{r_{\text{pack}}}(0) )}{ \mu(\mathbb{R}^d / \Lambda)}. 
\end{equation}\]</span></p>
<p>If we denote <span class="math inline">\(\SL(V)\)</span> to be the group of all unimodular linear transformations on <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span>, we can now define <span class="math display">\[\begin{align}
  c_{d} = \sup\left\{ \mu\left( g B_{r}(0)\right) \ | \ r&gt; 0,~g \in \SL(V) \text{ and } g B_{r}(0) \cap \Lambda_0 = \{ 0\}\right\}.
\end{align}\]</span> This quantity <span class="math inline">\(c_d\)</span> is related to the definition in  by <span class="math display">\[\begin{equation}
\tfrac{1}{2^{d}}    c_d =  \sup_{\substack{\Lambda \subseteq \mathbb{R}^{d},\\ \Lambda \text{ a lattice}} } \Delta(\Lambda).
\end{equation}\]</span> It then follows that for any lattice <span class="math inline">\(\Lambda \subseteq \mathbb{R}^{d}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\Delta(\Lambda) \ge \frac{1}{2^{d}} c_d\)</span>. The exact value of <span class="math inline">\(c_d\)</span> is known only for <span class="math inline">\(d \in \{1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,24\}\)</span>.  is a visualization of the fact that <span class="math inline">\(c_2=\tfrac{2\pi}{\sqrt{3}}\)</span>.</p>
<p> displays some known lower bounds on the lattice packing problem. The list is non-exhaustive since some individual dimensions have explicit lattice constructions that work very nicely for packing. However, these are currently the best known lower bounds for very large dimensions <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span>, letâ€™s say when <span class="math inline">\(d &gt; 400\)</span>. The common theme among all the results mentioned in  is the on homogeneous spaces. of probabilistic methods and Siegel transforms. That is, the proof techniques involve showing the existence of a well-rounded lattice by considering a large collection of random lattices.</p>
<p>Also, not all bounds mentioned in  are valid for all dimensions. To find which bound applies to given dimension could be computationally challenging as one would have to figure out the best way to express the dimension <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> as one of the parameters given in the table. Nevertheless, one could still estimate what is the asymptotic al growth in each of those lower bounds with <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span>.</p>
<p>One additional remark about  is that these are lower bounds on the lattice packing problem and yet turn out to be the best lower bounds on the sphere packing problem. It is completely unclear why should asking for the densest arrangement of spheres in high dimensions lead to the lattice arrangements, nonetheless finding provably better non-lattice packings in high dimensions is currently an open problem.</p>
<p>The last two results improve the lower bounds in packing densities for â€¦</p>
<h1 id="intended-project-in-paris">Intended project in Paris</h1>
<p>This research builds upon recent advancements in the equidistribution of closed geodesics on compact hyperbolic surfaces, as presented by Dr.Â Nguyen-Thi Dang (Orsay) and Dr.Â Jialun Li (Polytechnique) in a recent preprint <span class="citation" data-cites="DL22">[<a href="#ref-DL22" role="doc-biblioref">3</a>]</span>. There, they obtained a higher rank version of the Bowen-Margulis equidistribution theorem, also sometimes known as the prime geodesic theorem.</p>
<p>Let us try to explain the Bowen-Margulis theorem in a simpler setting.</p>
<p>Their research extends the theorem by demonstrating the equidistribution of flat tori in the quotient space <span class="math inline">\(\Gamma \backslash G / M\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> is a higher rank semisimple Lie group without compact factors, <span class="math inline">\(\Gamma\)</span> is a cocompact subgroup, and <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> is the compact part of the centralizer of the diagonal group <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\Gamma\)</span> is a torsion free discrete subgroup.</p>
<p>During a recent presentation by Dr.Â Nguyen-Thi Dang at the Ã‰cole de Printemps en GÃ©omÃ©trie et Dynamique 2023 in Lille, a question was posed regarding the statistical behavior of the module of flat tori as the volume of the tori or the systole goes to infinity. Along with Dr.Â Dang, Dr.Â Li, and Assistant Prof.Â Samuel LeliÃ¨vre (Orsay), I am currently conducting research to address this question. We are investigating simpler cases through numerical experiments and simulations. Our focus is on the equidistribution of unit lattices in number fields, a topic of interest due to conjectures attributed to Gromov and Margulis <span class="citation" data-cites="AR11">[<a href="#ref-AR11" role="doc-biblioref">4</a>]</span>. Our simulations are being conducted on simple setups, such as towers of two quadratic fields, as the systole or covolume of the lattice goes to infinity.</p>
